# P.A.S.T. â€” Personalized Assessment System for Tutoring

## Project Overview
**P.A.S.T.** is an AI-powered tutoring assistant designed to reduce academic stress and improve self-guided learning by dynamically generating multiple-choice questions and personalized feedback based on any topic the student inputs.

This tool helps students:
- Practice subject material in an interactive way
- Receive AI-generated feedback on their answers
- Reinforce understanding through guided correction

This project was developed as part of the **AI Remove Barriers** term project to demonstrate how artificial intelligence can assist learners in overcoming educational challenges like test anxiety, poor feedback access, and inconsistent study methods.

## How It Works

1. The student selects a **topic** (e.g., "World War II", "Binary Search", "Photosynthesis")
2. The system uses **Google's Gemini API** to generate a **multiple-choice question** with four answer options.
3. The student selects an answer (Aâ€“D).
4. Gemini evaluates the response and gives **personalized, constructive feedback**, including a helpful tip.
