Japan surrendered after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which occurred *after* Potsdam.  Also, while Potsdam highlighted growing tensions, it's not typically considered the official *start* of the Cold War.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Option D (Correct Answer):** The Casablanca Conference in January 1943 was attended by Churchill and Roosevelt (Stalin was not present).  The key decisions made there were the agreement to invade Italy (Operation Husky), the intensification of strategic bombing of Germany, and, importantly, the announcement of the Allied demand for \"unconditional surrender\" from the Axis powers.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Tip for remembering:**  Think of Casablanca as the conference where the Allies got tough.  The demand for \"unconditional surrender\" was a significant and uncompromising declaration. This strong stance can help you link Casablanca to this decision. You could also remember it by noting that Casablanca came *before* the other conferences listed, and the unconditional surrender demand was a precursor to the later discussions about occupation zones and post-war arrangements.\n"

They bind to a site *other* than the active site, called the allosteric site.  This binding changes the enzyme's shape, making it harder for the substrate to bind. Next time, pay close attention to keywords like \"allosteric,\" which points to a different mechanism than direct active site competition.\n",
